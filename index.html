    <section class="intro">
      <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Neuroscience with a foundation in physics and mathematics. My research bridges theoretical modeling and real-world applications in brain function and neurological disorders. I focus on simulating brain network dynamics using spiking neuron models and investigating how structural properties influence information processing.</p>

      <p>My ongoing projects have explored a variety of topics: how cortical timescales vary by brain region and layer, how short-range neural connections amplify long-range communication, and how inhibitory dynamics control network excitability. Through this work, I develop quantitative frameworks that contribute both to fundamental neuroscience and future brain-inspired computation systems.</p>

      <h2>Projects & Research</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Layer- and Area-Specific Dynamics and Function (Sep 2024 - Present)</strong><br>
          This project investigates how timescales differ across cortical layers and regions, with sensory areas exhibiting faster dynamics and integrative areas showing slower processing. I built comparative spiking network models of the cortex in rodents, primates, and humans, helping uncover functional differences shaped by brain structure and evolution.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Short-Distance Connections Enhance Neural Network Dynamics (June 2024 - Sep 2024)</strong><br>
          This research highlights how short-distance neural connections help signals travel efficiently across long distances in the brain. By increasing the number of common presynaptic inputs and clustering them spatially, these local connections boost the brainâ€™s ability to amplify and coordinate signals globally â€” crucial for understanding information transfer.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Inhibition Modulates the Exciting Ability of Recurrent Networks (May 2023 - June 2024)</strong><br>
          This study developed a model showing how varying the density and strength of inhibitory connections affects how easily brain networks become excited. We revealed complex roles of inhibitory neurons in determining critical points for activation, offering insights into how balance is maintained in neural systems.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Balance Between Excitatory and Inhibitory Inputs in Adaptive Networks (Oct 2020 - July 2022)</strong><br>
          As part of my Masterâ€™s thesis, I modeled how learning mechanisms â€” Hebbian and anti-Hebbian â€” influence balance in brain networks. The findings demonstrated that pre-existing balance can be maintained under certain learning rules, while unbalanced systems struggle to self-organize, shedding light on neural plasticity.
